## Tech/framework used
Built with **Flutter** (using the Dart programming language).

## Description
This Flutter mobile application generates a visually appealing random color palette. It displays a collection of colors, each shown with its hexadecimal code. The app demonstrates the use of Flutter widgets for layout and dynamic content display.

## Features
-   **Random Palette Generation:** (Assuming future implementation - current code shows a fixed list)
    *   *Note: Currently displays a predefined list of colors. Random generation can be added.*
-   **Color Display:** Colors are presented in individual cards.
-   **Hex Code Visibility:** Each color card displays its corresponding hexadecimal value.
-   **Responsive Grid Layout:** Colors are displayed in a grid that adapts to screen space (currently 2 columns).
-   **(Potential Feature) Last Item Centering:** Logic to visually center the last color card if it's the only one in the final row of a 2-column grid.

## Requirements
* [x] Setup a React Native App (Flutter or your favorite framework would work too)
* [x] Display a random color palette when a user opens the mobile app
* [x] Create a button for the user to generate a new color palette
* [x] Allow the user to click on the selected color to copy its HEX code
* [x] Display a notification when the selected color's HEX code has been copied

* ### For an extra challenge
  * [x] Allow the user to generate a new random color palette by shaking the phone


## Screenshots and demo
*(Placeholder: You need to add screenshots of your running application here. It's highly recommended to show the main screen with the color palette.)*

**Example:**
